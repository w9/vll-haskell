Installation
------------

First, you need to install [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). After Stack is installed,
clone this repo, `cd` into it and run the following command in your shell:

    $ make
    $ make install

This will build and install Vll into `~/.local/bin`. Make sure this folder is listed under `$PATH` and you are
good to go. Run `vll --help` in your shell for details.
